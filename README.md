Problem Statement

The objective of this project was to analyze survey responses related to mental health symptoms to determine how different states of depression (No depression, Mild, Moderate, Severe) affect work productivity. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualizing relationships between symptoms and depression states, and conducting statistical tests to explore the impact on work-related factors.

Objective:

The goal of this project was to analyze survey responses related to various mental health symptoms to classify individuals into different depression states (No depression, Mild, Moderate, Severe). The project involved cleaning and preprocessing the data, visualizing relationships between symptoms and depression states, and conducting statistical tests to identify significant differences between groups.

Results:

1. Depression State Distribution:

The data showed a fairly even distribution of individuals across the four depression states, with 'No depression' being the most common.

2. Symptom Correlations: 

Symptoms such as Worthlessness, Agitation, and Suicidal Ideation showed high correlations with each other and were strongly associated with more severe depression states.

3. Significant Differences:

The t-tests revealed significant differences in symptoms like Agitation between individuals with Mild and Severe depression, indicating that symptom severity increases with the severity of depression.

Conclusion:

The analysis successfully identified key symptoms associated with different depression states and provided insights into how these symptoms vary across individuals with different levels of depression. The findings could be useful for mental health professionals in diagnosing and treating depression, as well as for further research into mental health conditions.

Future Work:

1. Advanced Modeling:

Apply machine learning models to predict depression states based on symptom scores.

2. Larger Sample Size:

Collect and analyze data from a larger sample to increase the generalizability of the findings.

3. Longitudinal Analysis:

Explore changes in symptoms and depression states over time by analyzing longitudinal data, if available.
